title: 'Artin Entezarjou: "AI vs Doctors: Human Judgement Wins (for time being)
  in Complex Medical Contexts"'
description: Our host Iman Mossavat welcomes Dr. Artin Entezarjou, a
  board-certified general medicine specialist, to discuss AI's role in
  healthcare. Dr. Entezarjou highlights AI's progress and challenges in handling
  complex clinical scenarios. “Humans can outperform AI when questions aren’t
  multiple choice, especially when psychosocial factors are involved,” he
  explains. His research comparing GPT-4 to human doctors reveals AI's
  limitations in understanding real-world medical complexities and patient
  contexts. “Clinical decisions require more than symptoms; they demand insight
  into patients’ preferences and circumstances,” he says. Dr. Entezarjou
  stresses the continued need for human judgment, adding, “We’re still the
  masters of recognizing when more context is needed, though this is rapidly
  changing.” He advocates for AI systems that are robust, trustworthy, and
  intuitive, emphasizing their role in supporting—not replacing—physicians. “AI
  can excel in specific tasks, but general judgment remains human,” he concludes
