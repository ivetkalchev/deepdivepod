            <p class="description">The algorithm behind early versions of Siri, Google Translate, and Alexa? It wasn't invented by a tech giant. It was created by a master's student in the 1990s, rejected at first, then left to sleep quietly... until it changed the world. That student was Sepp Hochreiter, the inventor of LSTM, one of the most influential breakthroughs in AI. And now, he's back with TiRex, a time series foundation model that has outperformed others on Hugging Face time series leaderboard. It's fast, efficient, and built in Europe, where Sepp and his team at NXAI are betting on open source, smarter models, and AI that runs at the edge.In this episode, we explore how one of AI's pioneers is reshaping the future with fewer GPUs, smaller models, and a bold vision for European innovation.</p>

            <p class="description">In this episode of Deep Dives with Iman, I speak with Dr. Tina Nikoukhah —applied mathematician, media forensics expert, and Director of Research at GetReal. We talk about how synthetic media is evolving, and how researchers like Tina are working to stay ahead of the curve. Tina shares why building public awareness is just as critical as tech solutions. (In fact, awareness and training are one of the four pillars of GetReal's approach, alongside real-time protection for live communication, media analysis tools, and support for media orgs.) It's a conversation about trust, technology, and how to navigate a digital world where seeing isn't always believing.</p>

            <p class="description">Can probability theory help explain how the mind works? This is the topic of this episode with Dr. Hadi Vafaii, a postdoctoral scholar at UC Berkeley’s Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, working in Jacob Yates’s lab. Hadi builds intuition step by step, using simple, relatable examples. He explains a mathematical perspective on how the brain processes information by inferring the unobserved causes behind what we see and hear, combining context with new evidence.</p>

We discuss his latest book, The Dark Pattern, co-authored with Dr. Ulrich Hoffrage, which explores how even well-intentioned leaders can become ethically blind under intense organizational pressures. Through real-world cases from major global firms, Guido reveals how good people can end up doing bad things. He identifies nine recurring conditions that foster cultures where unethical behavior becomes normalized. Guido also shares his insights on how technology and AI can further deepen ethical lapses by adding layers of abstraction and distance.</p>

Shea shares his journey from studying the cosmos to interrogating AI systems, pointing out how scientific skepticism must carry over into today's tech landscape. At BABL AI, he leads efforts to audit and govern AI to ensure it serves human interests, especially in high-stakes areas like hiring, credit scoring, and public services. With real-world examples and hands-on audit methods, Shea explains how AI systems often fail silently and how risk-based auditing can surface hidden harms.

            <p class="description">I explore the complex intersection of algorithms and education policy with Mayesha Tasnim and Paul Verhagen of the Civic AI Lab at the University of Amsterdam. In cities like Amsterdam and Eindhoven, school placement is increasingly driven by algorithms. But how fair and transparent are these systems?Together, we unpack how public algorithms shape student futures, revealing the trade-offs between fairness, efficiency, and transparency. From the role of lotteries in Amsterdam's admissions to the challenges of "gaming the system," this episode dives into what it truly means to design equitable technology in public policy. Listeners gain rare insight into how smarter algorithms can improve outcomes, while still risking unintended consequences.</p>

Calling herself a “wandering mathematician,” she connects pure math with real-world problems—from epidemic modeling and radiomics to data analysis. Colleen shares her experience modeling to help position resources that limited an Ebola outbreak. She explains how understanding the geometry and topology of medical images helps generative algorithms produce medically plausible data. She also highlights how tools useful in one domain, like finance, can be applied to others such as ecology or marketing.

Yulia builds robots that perceive, plan, and act in the real world using data- and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. She states that we discovered our brain didn’t evolve for abstract tasks, it evolved to move. Even small children show cognitive behaviors grounded in movement. [...] Like when we were little, doing simple addition- ‘seven plus two’ - we imagine seven on a number line and move right two units. We place things in space.</p>

            <p class="description">Iman Mossavat engages Robert Engels, Head of AI Futures Lab at Capgemini, in a discussion on the role of context and abstraction in AI. With 36 years of experience, Engels examines why current generative AI systems, like GPT-4, excel at tasks yet fail in complex, real-world settings. Robert argues, \“Two things are underperforming in the world of generative AI—abstraction and logical reasoning.\” Robert underscores the need for AI to adopt a world model akin to philosophical reasoning: "Plato and Socrates understood this when they built logics—they looked at the world and tried to grasp its principles." </p>

            <p class="description">Our host Iman Mossavat welcomes Dr. Artin Entezarjou, a board-certified general medicine specialist, to discuss AI's role in healthcare. Dr. Entezarjou highlights AI's progress and challenges in handling complex clinical scenarios. “Humans can outperform AI when questions aren’t multiple choice, especially when psychosocial factors are involved,” he explains. His research comparing GPT-4 to human doctors reveals AI's limitations in understanding real-world medical complexities and patient contexts. “Clinical decisions require more than symptoms; they demand insight into patients’ preferences and circumstances,” he says. Dr. Entezarjou stresses the continued need for human judgment, adding, “We’re still the masters of recognizing when more context is needed, though this is rapidly changing.” He advocates for AI systems that are robust, trustworthy, and intuitive, emphasizing their role in supporting—not replacing—physicians. “AI can excel in specific tasks, but general judgment remains human,” he concludes</p>

Diederik specializes in <strong>Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL)</strong>, a framework that shifts focus from optimizing a single outcome to balancing multiple, sometimes competing, objectives. 

                Drawing on the ancient idea of balance—akin to Yin and Yang—Diederik challenges the status quo of “maximizing more.” Instead, he advocates for pursuing outcomes that are <strong>"good enough"</strong>, prioritizing practicality, ethics, and societal benefit over perfection. 
                
                💡 Key Insight: How can AI navigate trade-offs like maximizing rewards while minimizing risks? Diederik’s vision emphasizes deliberate choices in AI design, promoting transparency, maintainability, and alignment with societal values. Together, they explore how AI can serve everyone fairly—not just a select few—while balancing innovation and responsibility.

                Tune in for a refreshing perspective on building AI systems that prioritize balance, fairness, and shared benefit.
