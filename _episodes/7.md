title: "Lazy But Brilliant: How LazyDynamics is Set to Redefine Real-Time
  Decision Making with Reactive AI"
description: "Join Iman Mossavat for an insightful episode with special guests
  Albert Podusenko and İsmail Şenöz, as we dive into the innovative world of
  Lazy Dynamics. This cutting-edge company is reshaping how agents process and
  act on real-time data in unpredictable environments. Their software
  streamlines the development of intelligent systems capable of navigating
  uncertainty — whether it's an ambulance optimizing routes or legal tech
  helping lawyers model strategic uncertainties in complex litigation. At the
  heart of their approach is RxInfer, a fast and efficient tool designed to
  overcome the computational limitations of traditional probabilistic
  programming libraries, enabling real-time decision-making. With a unique
  reactive message-passing system, Lazy Dynamics ensures agents can keep
  reasoning even if some sensors fail — a true breakthrough for dynamic,
  high-stakes environments. Discover how collaboration and open-source
  contributions are fueling their success and how these innovations are shaping
  the future. Tune in for an episode packed with insights into the future of AI
  and real-time decision-making! For more about the guests:"
