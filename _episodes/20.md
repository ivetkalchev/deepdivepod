title: Where Geometry Meets Mission with Colleen Farrelly
description: "Colleen Farrelly uses mathematics as a versatile tool across many
  fields, driven by curiosity and social purpose. Calling herself a “wandering
  mathematician,” she connects pure math with real-world problems—from epidemic
  modeling and radiomics to data analysis. Colleen shares her experience
  modeling to help position resources that limited an Ebola outbreak. She
  explains how understanding the geometry and topology of medical images helps
  generative algorithms produce medically plausible data. She also highlights
  how tools useful in one domain, like finance, can be applied to others such as
  ecology or marketing. She stresses the importance of critical thinking:
  questioning and exploring better approaches."
