title: Perception as Inference with Dr. Hadi Vafaii
description: Can probability theory help explain how the mind works? This is the
  topic of this episode with Dr. Hadi Vafaii, a postdoctoral scholar at UC
  Berkeley’s Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, working in Jacob
  Yates’s lab. Hadi builds intuition step by step, using simple, relatable
  examples. He explains a mathematical perspective on how the brain processes
  information by inferring the unobserved causes behind what we see and hear,
  combining context with new evidence.
