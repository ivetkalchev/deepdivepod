title: Embodied Cognition, Dynamical Systems & Attractor Networks in Care Robotics
description: In this episode of Deep Dives with Iman, I speak with Prof. Dr.
  Yulia Sandamirskaya, head of the Center for Cognitive Computing in Life
  Sciences at Zurich University of Applied Sciences. Yulia builds robots that
  perceive, plan, and act in the real world using data- and energy-efficient
  neuromorphic computing. She states that we discovered our brain didn’t evolve
  for abstract tasks, it evolved to move. Even small children show cognitive
  behaviors grounded in movement. [...] Like when we were little, doing simple
  addition- ‘seven plus two’ - we imagine seven on a number line and move right
  two units. We place things in space.
