title: 'Robert Engels: "Agents need the same thing as you and I: they need an
  idea of intent and purpose of the counterpart or adversary"'
description: 'Iman Mossavat engages Robert Engels, Head of AI Futures Lab at
  Capgemini, in a discussion on the role of context and abstraction in AI. With
  36 years of experience, Engels examines why current generative AI systems,
  like GPT-4, excel at tasks yet fail in complex, real-world settings. Robert
  argues, \“Two things are underperforming in the world of generative
  AI—abstraction and logical reasoning.\” Robert underscores the need for AI to
  adopt a world model akin to philosophical reasoning: "Plato and Socrates
  understood this when they built logics—they looked at the world and tried to
  grasp its principles."'
