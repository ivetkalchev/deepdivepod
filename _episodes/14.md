title: Could Generative AI be Useful for Science and Understanding the World?
description: In this episode, Jakub Tomczak, a leading figure in Generative AI
  and former Program Chair of NeurIPS 2024, shares his insights on the
  transformative impact of Generative AI, not just in the field of artificial
  intelligence but in scientific discovery as well. Jakub explains how this
  technology is reshaping our understanding of generation processes and its
  potential to revolutionize various domains. Jakub offers a thought-provoking
  perspective on AI's societal implications, inviting us to be mindful. For
  those interested in a deeper dive into his work, Jakub's book, Deep Generative
  Modeling, is an essential resource on advanced AI models, including diffusion,
  flow, and energy-based models, GANs, and Variational Autoencoders.
