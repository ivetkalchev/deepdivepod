title: How can nature inspire artificial intelligence research to revolutionize
  energy efficiency? Dr. Federico Corradi explains.
description: A brief introduction to neuromorphic computing by Dr. Federico
  Corradi, Assistant Professor at TU Eindhoven. Specializing in energy-efficient
  AI inspired by the brain, Dr. Corradi leads the Neuromorphic Edge Computing
  Systems Lab, exploring how nature's principles can reshape AI to consume less
  energy. In this episode, Dr. Corradi explains how the brainâ€™s minimal energy
  use inspires new AI systems, addressing the massive energy demands of large
  language models. In his line of research, the boundary between hardware and
  software is increasingly blurred. Designing algorithms and hardware together
  could transform AI into more sustainable and independent systems, enabling
  smarter edge devices without cloud reliance.
