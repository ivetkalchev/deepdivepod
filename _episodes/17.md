title: Safe AI For Children
description: I had the privilege of speaking with Tara Steele, Founder and
  Director of the Safe AI for Children Alliance. We discussed the growing
  concerns around AI’s impact on children, particularly with the rise of grief
  bots—chatbots designed to simulate deceased people—and the lack of
  understanding regarding their effects.
