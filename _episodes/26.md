title: Sepp Hochreiter, LSTM, and the Rise of TiRex, The King of Time
description: The algorithm behind early versions of Siri, Google Translate, and
  Alexa? It wasn't invented by a tech giant. It was created by a master's
  student in the 1990s, rejected at first, then left to sleep quietly... until
  it changed the world. That student was Sepp Hochreiter, the inventor of LSTM,
  one of the most influential breakthroughs in AI. And now, he's back with
  TiRex, a time series foundation model that has outperformed others on Hugging
  Face time series leaderboard. It's fast, efficient, and built in Europe, where
  Sepp and his team at NXAI are betting on open source, smarter models, and AI
  that runs at the edge.In this episode, we explore how one of AI's pioneers is
  reshaping the future with fewer GPUs, smaller models, and a bold vision for
  European innovation.
