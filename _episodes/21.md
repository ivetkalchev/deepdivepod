title: "AI for School Selection in the Netherlands: Efficient, Fair, or
  Transparent â€” Pick Two Out of Three!"
description: I explore the complex intersection of algorithms and education
  policy with Mayesha Tasnim and Paul Verhagen of the Civic AI Lab at the
  University of Amsterdam. In cities like Amsterdam and Eindhoven, school
  placement is increasingly driven by algorithms. But how fair and transparent
  are these systems?Together, we unpack how public algorithms shape student
  futures, revealing the trade-offs between fairness, efficiency, and
  transparency. From the role of lotteries in Amsterdam's admissions to the
  challenges of "gaming the system," this episode dives into what it truly means
  to design equitable technology in public policy. Listeners gain rare insight
  into how smarter algorithms can improve outcomes, while still risking
  unintended consequences.
