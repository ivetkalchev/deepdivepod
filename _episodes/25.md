title: "Digital Detectives: The Science of Media Forensics"
description: In this episode of Deep Dives with Iman, I speak with Dr. Tina
  Nikoukhah â€”applied mathematician, media forensics expert, and Director of
  Research at GetReal. We talk about how synthetic media is evolving, and how
  researchers like Tina are working to stay ahead of the curve. Tina shares why
  building public awareness is just as critical as tech solutions. (In fact,
  awareness and training are one of the four pillars of GetReal's approach,
  alongside real-time protection for live communication, media analysis tools,
  and support for media orgs.) It's a conversation about trust, technology, and
  how to navigate a digital world where seeing isn't always believing.
