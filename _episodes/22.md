title: The true value of AI lies more in thorough testing and evaluation than in
  coding or prompting, with Dr. Shea Brown, BABL AI CEO
description: I got the opportunity to talk to Dr. Shea Brown, former
  astrophysics professor, and founder of BABL AI, for a sharp look at AI
  accountability. Shea shares his journey from studying the cosmos to
  interrogating AI systems, pointing out how scientific skepticism must carry
  over into today's tech landscape. At BABL AI, he leads efforts to audit and
  govern AI to ensure it serves human interests, especially in high-stakes areas
  like hiring, credit scoring, and public services. With real-world examples and
  hands-on audit methods, Shea explains how AI systems often fail silently and
  how risk-based auditing can surface hidden harms. Shea hopes for a future
  where regulation, education, and responsible inno, education, and responsible
  innovation work hand in hand for human flourishing.
