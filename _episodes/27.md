description: In this episode, Dr. Guido Palazzo joins me to uncover the hidden
  dynamics behind corporate scandals. We discuss his latest book, The Dark
  Pattern, co-authored with Dr. Ulrich Hoffrage, which explores how even
  well-intentioned leaders can become ethically blind under intense
  organizational pressures. Through real-world cases from major global firms,
  Guido reveals how good people can end up doing bad things. He identifies nine
  recurring conditions that foster cultures where unethical behavior becomes
  normalized. Guido also shares his insights on how technology and AI can
  further deepen ethical lapses by adding layers of abstraction and distance.
