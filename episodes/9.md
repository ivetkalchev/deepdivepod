title: 'Diederik Roijers: "What If We Optimized for Enough, Not More?"'
description: 'Join Iman Mossavat as he speaks with Diederik Roijers, senior
  researcher at the AI Lab at Vrije Universiteit Brussel. Diederik specializes
  in Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL), a framework that shifts
  focus from optimizing a single outcome to balancing multiple, sometimes
  competing, objectives. Drawing on the ancient idea of balance‚Äîakin to Yin and
  Yang‚ÄîDiederik challenges the status quo of ‚Äúmaximizing more.‚Äù Instead, he
  advocates for pursuing outcomes that are "good enough", prioritizing
  practicality, ethics, and societal benefit over perfection. üí° Key Insight:
  How can AI navigate trade-offs like maximizing rewards while minimizing risks?
  Diederik‚Äôs vision emphasizes deliberate choices in AI design, promoting
  transparency, maintainability, and alignment with societal values. Together,
  they explore how AI can serve everyone fairly‚Äînot just a select few‚Äîwhile
  balancing innovation and responsibility. Tune in for a refreshing perspective
  on building AI systems that prioritize balance, fairness, and shared benefit.'
